# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name: Transformer Implementation in CUDA C++  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Owner:** Gage Anderson

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing the Transformer model from the 2017 *“Attention is All You Need”* paper using CUDA C++ for efficient execution on NVIDIA GPUs of Ampere generation or newer. The goal is to create a lightweight model with less than 100 million parameters that can be executed via a command-line interface (CLI).

---

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
- Develop a Transformer model programmed in CUDA C++ optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.
- Ensure the model runs efficiently with Ampere or newer GPU architectures.
- Provide a CLI for users to run and test the Transformer model.
- Keep the total parameter count of the model under 100 million.

### 2.2 Non-Goals
- No need for a graphical user interface (GUI).
- No integration with other frameworks (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).

## 3. Specifications

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Must implement the standard Transformer encoder or decoder stack from the 2017 paper.
  - Include components such as multi-head self-attention, feedforward layers, layer normalization, and residual connections.
  - Parameter count should not exceed 100 million.
  
- **CUDA Implementation:**
  - Parallelize computations to fully utilize GPU resources.
  - Optimize kernel launches for matrix multiplications, softmax, and attention mechanisms.

- **Command Line Interface:**
  - Provide CLI commands to initialize, run, and benchmark the model.
  - Allow users to specify the number of layers, hidden dimension size, and number of attention heads.
  - Example commands:  
    - Initialize: `transformer --layers=6 --hidden_dim=512 --heads=8`  
    - Run: `transformer --input_file=input.txt --output_file=output.txt`

- **Random Weight Initialization:**
  - Initialize all weights (e.g., attention weights, feedforward layer weights) using a random distribution.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - Ensure execution is optimized for Ampere architecture or newer.
  - Achieve reasonable runtime efficiency for small-scale Transformer models.
  
- **Usability:**
  - Provide clear error messages for invalid CLI input.
  - Include documentation on how to compile and use the program.
  
- **Scalability:**
  - Support future expansion to larger models by keeping parameter initialization modular.

## 4. Constraints
- The implementation must use CUDA C++ as the primary programming language.
- The total model size must remain under 100 million parameters.
- Only NVIDIA GPUs of Ampere generation or newer are supported.

---

## 5. User Stories
- As a machine learning researcher, I want to run the Transformer model from the command line, so I can test its performance on small datasets.
- As a GPU programming enthusiast, I want to learn how CUDA is used to implement Transformer operations, so I can deepen my knowledge of parallel programming.
- As a software engineer, I want a clear CLI interface to run and benchmark the Transformer, so I can integrate it into a larger pipeline.
